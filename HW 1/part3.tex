	\emph{apt (Advanced Package Tool)} is the command-line tool for handling packages. It provides a command-line interface for the package management of the system. See also apt-get and apt-cache for more low-level command options.
	\newpage
	The  \emph{top}  program  provides  a dynamic real-time view of a running system.  It can display system summary information as  well  as  a list  of processes or threads currently being managed by the Linux kernel.  The types of system summary  information  shown  and  the types,  order  and size of information displayed for processes are all user configurable and that configuration can be  made  persistent across restarts.
